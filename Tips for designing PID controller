General Tips for Designing a PID Controller
-------------------------------------------

When you are designing a PID controller for a given system, follow the steps shown below to obtain a desired response.

   1. Obtain an open-loop response and determine what needs to be improved
   2. Add a proportional control to improve the rise time
   3. Add a derivative control to reduce the overshoot
   4. Add an integral control to reduce the steady-state error
   5. Adjust each of the gains $K_p$, $K_i$, and $K_d$ until you obtain a desired overall response. You can always refer to the table shown in this "PID Tutorial" page to find out which controller controls which characteristics.

Lastly, please keep in mind that you do not need to implement all three controllers (proportional, derivative, and integral) into a single system, if not necessary. For example, if a PI controller meets the given requirements (like the above example), then you don't need to implement a derivative controller on the system. Keep the controller as simple as possible.

An example of tuning a PI controller on an actual physical system can be found at the following link. This example also begins to illustrate some challenges of implementing control, including: control saturation, integrator wind-up, and noise amplification.
